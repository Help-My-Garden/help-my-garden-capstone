<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>John is a Cashier at the local grocery store. He recently bought a house after his divorce and wants to make some changes to his yard.

He doesn't know much about plants but doesn't mind spending extra work on taking care of them.</p>


<h2>Frustrations and Needs</h2>
<p>John is not a tech savvy person so he does not want to waste time on a complicated website.  John wants a fast way to get some plants for his new gardening project but does not want to spend a lot of time at a local plant store. He wants to spend less than 20 minutes at the store. </p>

<h2>Behaviours and Attitudes</h2>
<p>John enjoys being alone, so spending extra time taking care of plants does not bother him.
    John doesn't have much patience so he avoids complicated websites or apps.  John joined the local garden group and wants to learn more about plants.
